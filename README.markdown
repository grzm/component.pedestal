# Pedestal Service wrapper for Component Systems

The Pedestal Component library provides a convenient way to use Pedestal
in [Component][component] systems. Besides Pedestal participating as a normal
component in the system, other components can be made available to interceptors
through the Pedestal context.

Pedestal Component also provides test helpers for starting and stopping the
system.

## Usage

```clojure
(ns com.example.myapp
  (:require [com.grzm.component.pedestal :as cp]))
```

Pedestal Component provides a constructor that takes a single
0-arity function which returns the Pedestal configuration service map.
The service map is passed to `io.pedestal.http/create-server`.

```clojure
(cp/pedestal config-fn) ;; => cp/Pedestal record
```

There are two helper functions for managing components within Pedestal.

 * `(cp/using-component :component-key)` is returns an interceptor which adds a
   component to the Pedestal context, making it available via the request map.
 * `(cp/use-component request :component-key)` returns the component from the
   request map.

```clojure
(ns com.example.myapp.server
  (:gen-class)
  (:require [io.pedestal.http :as http]
            [io.pedestal.http.body-params :refer [body-params]]
            [io.pedestal.http.route :as route]
            [ring.util.response :as ring-resp]
            [com.stuartsierra.component :as component]
            [com.grzm.component.pedestal :as cp]
            [com.example.myapp.component.application :as app]
            [com.example.myapp.component.database :as db]))

(defn home-page []
  (ring-resp/response "Welcome!"))

(defn login-page
  [{:keys [form-params] :as request}]
  (let [app (cp/use-component request :app)
        {:keys [username password]} form-params]
    (if-let [user (app/user-by-creds {:username username :password password})]
      (ring-resp/response (str "Welcome, " (:user/first-name user) "!"))
      (ring-resp/redirect (route/url-for :home-page)))))

(def routes #{["/" :get [(body-params)
                         `home-page]]
              ["/login" :post [(body-params)
                               (cp/using-component :app)
                               `login-page]]})

(defn pedestal-config-fn "Return Pedestal service map" [] 
 ;; routes and other interesting bits
)

(def config {:pedestal {:config-fn pedestal-config-fn}
             :db {:conn-uri "datomic:dev://localhost:4334/myapp"}})

(defn system [{:keys [pedestal db]}]
  (component/system-map
    :db (db/database (:conn-uri db))
    :app (component/using (app/application) [:db]
    :pedestal (component/using (cp/pedestal (:config-fn pedestal))
                 [:app])))

(defn start-system [sys]
  (component/start sys)
  (.addShutdownHook (Runtime/getRuntime)
                    (Thread. #(component/stop sys))))

(defn -main [& args]
  (start-system (system config)))
  
```

## Testing

```clojure
(ns com.example.yourapp.test
  (:require [com.grzm.component.pedestal.test.alpha :as cpt]))
```

There are two functions and a macro that are useful for testing:

 * The `cpt/with-system` macro wraps a test body.
   It handles starting the system, catching any exception that might
   be thrown during the running of the tests, and stopping the system.
   You provide it with the system variable and an system initialization
   function: `(cpt/with-system #'system init-fn ...)`
 * The `cpt/service` function takes the system and
   returns its service function, suitable for passing to the Pedestal
   `response-for` testing function.
 * The `cpt/ring-handler` function takes the system
   and returns a Ring handler suitable for using with Nelson Morris'
   [Peridot][peridot] library. This is very useful for making multiple
   requests where you need to maintain state between requests.

There's also a `PedestalServlet` component to use for testing in lieu of the
Pedestal component used in production.

```clojure
(ns com.example.myapp.handler-test
   (:require [clojure.test :refer :all]
             [io.pedestal.test :refer :all]
             [com.grzm.component.pedestal.test.alpha :as cpt]
             [com.grzm.component.pedestal :as cp]
             [com.example.myapp.component.application :as app]
             [com.example.myapp.component.database :as db]             
             [peridot.core :as p]))

(def system nil)
(def test-config
  {:pedestal {:config-fn pedestal-config-fn}
   :db {:conn-uri "datomic:dev://localhost:4334/myapp-test"}})

(defn test-system
  "Set up using PedestalServlet component instead of Pedestal"
  [{:keys [pedestal db]}]
  (component/system-map
    :db (db/database (:conn-uri db))
    :app (component/using (app/application) [:db]
    :pedestal (component/using (cp/pedestal-servlet (:config-fn pedestal))
                 [:app])))

(defn init-fn []
  (constantly (test-system test-config)))

(deftest test-home-page
  "Use the Pedestal `response-for` function for testing simple requests"
  (cpt/with-system #'system init-fn
    (let [response (response-for (cpt/service system) :get "/")
          {:keys [body status headers]} response]
       (is (= status 200))
       (is (= "text/html" (get headers "Content-Type")))
       (is (.contains body "Welcome!")))))

(deftest test-failed-login
  "Use Nelson Morris' Peridot library for maintaining state between requests."
  (cpt/with-system #'system init-fn
    (-> (p/session (cpt/ring-handler system))
        (p/request "/login" :request-method :post
                   :params {:username "no-such-user@example.com"
                            :password "none-shall-pass!"})
        (doto ((fn [{:keys [response]}]
                 (let [{:keys [body status headers]} response]
                    (is (= 302 status))
                    (is (= "/" (get headers "Location")))))))
        (p/follow-redirect)
        ;; ...
        )))
```     

## Thanks!

Thanks to [Stuart Sierra][stuart-github] for [Component][component] and the first
draft of [component.pedestal][], and to [Gijs Stuurman][gijs-github] for his use
of Component with Pedestal in his [w3a][] library and allowing me to include his
code to wrap Pedestal service-fn in a Ring handler. Great stuff!
